			<Text>Eternal glory and praise for you, strong, bold but kind maiden. You are the highly respected Holy Maiden of the Grand Bell, which aims to create more land for the people – Metafalica. This means you are one of the leaders in the campaign against the Goddess, Frelia, who has been refusing to allow the people to create more land for no apparent reason.You at first is harsh, demanding, often borders on rude, and incredibly distrustful of others. As a celebrity with such an attitude, you often takes compliments from people such as Luca with a grain of salt.  Though constantly doubted yourself, always feeling as though bears a great responsibility, and that you couldn’t get anything accomplished, but you kept your confidence. You felt so troubled that you were thankful to find Sasha, one of the very few people to treat you like a normal person, though due to ignorance of her status, an additional rarity. Less hidden is your immense love for Gergo products, to the point where you befriended a fellow Gergo enthusiast, Cocona, because of it.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Oh charismatic maiden, your people desire that you rise and lead them again in the creation of new world, Metafalica.  Will you meet their challenge and lead them to realise their dreams? Will you restore your lands and build an empire to stand the test of time?</Text>
