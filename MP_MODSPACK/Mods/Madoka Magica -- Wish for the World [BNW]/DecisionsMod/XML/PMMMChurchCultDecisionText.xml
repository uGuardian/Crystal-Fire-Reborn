				Obtaining the full, in-color series of "Puella Magi Madoka Magica" and "Puella Magi Madoka Magica: Rebellion" -- the Holy Books which detail the creation myths of Madoka and Homura, respectively -- will be costly. Especially if you also commission the apocrypha, like "The Different Story." But that won't stop the devout otaku of your Civilization![NEWLINE]

			<Text>The Luminous is a ceremony in which two priestesses of the Church of Madoka or the Cult of Homura set up chairs beside each other in the middle of a grassy field, sit in those chairs, and then nuzzle their faces together. It is considered a very holy ritual for both religions.[NEWLINE]</Text>
