				Madoka Kaname, you just might be the nicest, purest, and sweetest girl on this planet. But even you have your vices. Like your mother before you, you happened to pick up the habit of drinking like a fish. But hey, who says you have to drink alone? Why not make an official holiday for the sole purpose of giving thousands of Magical Girls hangovers? (It's okay, they can turn off their ability to feel pain in the morning.)[NEWLINE]

				If there's one thing Mitakihara could use, it's a mascot. Something that truly tells visitors where they are when they wait at a bus stop. Suggestions of using Kyubey would probably be met with tomatoes and empty bottles being thrown at you. A rich, renowned artist has offered her talents to you in exchange for a hefty sum of gold, and has promised to create Mi-ta-kun, a mascot which the whole city will surely love. "Veni, vidi, Mitakihara."[NEWLINE]
