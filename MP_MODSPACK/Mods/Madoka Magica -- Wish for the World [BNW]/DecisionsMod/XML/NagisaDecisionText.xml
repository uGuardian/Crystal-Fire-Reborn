				You're still a small child at heart, and thus you empathize with the children in your schools. Education is perhaps the single most vital factor in turning your nation into a superpower, but kids at that age still need breaks and time to play.

				The stories of your past existence as the Witch Charlotte strike fear into soldiers the world over. You were able to kill even veteran Magical Girls in just a single bite. Merely painting an image of Charlotte over the gate of a keep -- making its entry look like her maw -- will terrify some of the lesser men and Magical Girls out there.[NEWLINE]

				Charlotte was the Witch form of Nagisa Momoe in past timelines and worlds. Assuming a seemingly harmless and cute form at first, she lured unsuspecting Magical Girls to reckless assaults with her appearance of helplessness. However, once this initial form was attacked enough, her true, monstrous form would emerge. Charlotte was capable of killing Mami Tomoe -- a veteran and powerful Magical Girl -- in a single bite. (Though she certainly took more than just one bite out of her.)[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]While Nagisa is back to her old Magical Girl self, stories of Charlotte persist in this world, and the image of Charlotte's true form is one which brings terror to those who know the story.
