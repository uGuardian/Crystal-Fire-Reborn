		<Row Tag="TXT_KEY_PMMM_MGRELATIONSHIP_ACQUAINTANCES_TOOLTIP">
			<Text>

		<Row Tag="TXT_KEY_PMMM_MGRELATIONSHIP_LOVE_TOOLTIP">
			<Text>
				She and {1_Str} have finally made it official that what they have is no mere friendship. They are easily the most important people in each others' lives, and they are completely devoted to each other in virtually all capacities.
			</Text>
		</Row>
		<Row Tag="TXT_KEY_PMMM_MGRELATIONSHIP_FATED_COUPLE_TOOLTIP">
			<Text>
				If ever proof existed of the "Red String of Fate," it can be found in the power of love shared between these two girls. The two of them seem to have been brought together by the universe itself, and it seems that not even death could separate them anymore.

		<Row Tag="TXT_KEY_PMMM_MGRELATIONSHIP_MORTAL_ENEMIES_TOOLTIP">
			<Text>
				These girls have made it one of their life's missions to make the other one miserable, if not outright kill each other. The seething hate and vitriol they display for each other is bound to reach a breaking point soon, and their relationship can never be reconciled.
