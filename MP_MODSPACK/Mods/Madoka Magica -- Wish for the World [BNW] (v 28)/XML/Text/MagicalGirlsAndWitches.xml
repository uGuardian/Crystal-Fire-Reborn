				Young girls, typically aged between 11-15 years old, can be considered candidates to become Magical Girls. A girl's potential to become a magical girl is based on how important she is to the world at large (e.g. the daughter of a world leader is extremely likely to have potential), and is also affected by how much pain and suffering the girl is destined to go through in life. They are given the ability to wish for anything they want one time -- be it wealth, knowledge, love, or even a second chance at life. However, once they do this, they forever become Magical Girls, and must hunt Wraiths from then on. Though the life of a Magical Girl is tough, it is practically a vacation compared to the lives they led prior to Madoka's wish.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Their spirits are stored in a trinket known as a Soul Gem. Having their souls detached from their bodies allows them to ignore any physical pain if they so choose. Additionally, they can use magic to quickly heal their bodies from nearly any injury, as long as their Soul Gems remain intact and uncorrupted.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]While virtually all of the inhabitants of Madoka's Realm and the cities it controls are Magical Girls, these girls in particular are those who have incredible magical potential. Though they start out no stronger than a typical fighter, they soon progress far beyond their peers with continued experience.

				The Great Magical Girl is a special unit which is only produced when Madoka's Realm expends a Great Person. It has the same basic stats as a Warrior, but has powerful promotions which are unavailable to any other units. It additionally has a bonus ability depending on which type of Great Person was expended to create it. Whenever a technology is researched which allows for the construction of a new Melee or Gunpowder unit (which follows the upgrade tree of the Warrior), the Great Magical Girl will automatically gain an upgrade to its [ICON_STRENGTH] Combat Strength to make it equal to the newly trainable unit. This will only happen once the unit is within Madoka's borders at the beginning of her turn.

				Special unit created from the expenditure of a Great Person. It has a special tree of promotions and will automatically gain increases in [ICON_STRENGTH] Combat Strength when your Civilization reaches a new Era. These units may form Relationships with other Magical Girls. However, their Soul Gems must also be kept clean by using Grief Seeds.

				Witches are nightmarish creatures born from the world's curses. Typically hiding within their Barriers, they feed on humans by luring them inside their Barriers with a Witch's Kiss, which controls the minds of those afflicted. However, they are hunted by Magical Girls to help keep the world safe from them.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Unfortunately, the truth behind what a Witch really is can shatter the psyches of all but the most stoic Magical Girls. The truth is that, once a Magical Girl's Soul Gem gets completely blackened, it shatters and that girl becomes a Witch herself.

				The Witch is a special unit only available to the Hostile (Barbarian) faction and Madoka's Realm. It is a powerful creature which seeks to eat humans. Any Civilization which destroys one earns a Grief Seed, which can be used to purify the corruption of a Magical Girl's Soul Gem.

				Monstrous creature born from Curses. Normally only found in the Hostile faction. When defeated, they drop a [ICON_PMMM_GRIEF_SEED] Grief Seed, which can be used by Magical Girls to clean their [ICON_PMMM_SOUL_GEM] Soul Gems.

			<Text>
				Familiars are born from the evil energies created by Witches. While they are not as powerful as their mother Witch, they attack in much larger numbers. A Familiar which eats enough humans may turn into a fully-grown Witch itself. Until Familiars grow into Witches, they do not leave behind Grief Seeds upon their death. Many of the more pragmatic Magical Girls in the world will thus allow a Familiar to escape and eat other humans, so that they may hunt the newly-matured Witch down for its Grief Seed. Tensions tend to be high between Magical Girls who do this and those who tend towards the path of altruism and heroism.

				The Familiar is a special unit only available to the Hostile (Barbarian) faction, though it is also possible for Germany to obtain them. They are much weaker than Witches, but do not drop Grief Seeds upon their deaths. Therefore, unless they are posing an immediate threat to your cities or units, it may be a good idea to allow Familiars to roam free until they mature into Witches.

				Available only to the Hostile faction. While they are incapable of attacking and do not deal any damage even if melee attacked (in technical terms, the damage they DO deal is healed back), they are difficult to kill due to their evasive maneuvering. If they end up near a Magical Girl during the Hostile turn, they will Emotionally Manipulate the girl, causing a major [ICON_PMMM_MOOD] Mood penalty. And there is even a small chance that they will reveal The Truth to the girl, should you have allowed a large number of your Magical Girls to become Witches...
