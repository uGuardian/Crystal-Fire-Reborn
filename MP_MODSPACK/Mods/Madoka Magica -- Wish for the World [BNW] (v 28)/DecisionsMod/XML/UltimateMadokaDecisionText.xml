				Love between two girls is the purest form of love, at least according to certain sources on the Internet. In your Realm, where Y chromosomes do not exist, you can declare your half-reality half-afterlife world as Yuri Valhalla, making all of your Magical Girls ecstatic. Don't think too deeply about how this improves Population Growth. (Well, you *can*, but that makes you lewd and a /d/eviant.)[NEWLINE]

				[NEWLINE][ICON_BULLET]Player must be Madoka's Realm
				[NEWLINE][ICON_BULLET]Must have at least 4 Magical Girls

				[NEWLINE][ICON_BULLET]{1_Culture} [ICON_GOLD] Gold
				[NEWLINE][ICON_BULLET]2 [ICON_MAGISTRATES] Magistrates
				[NEWLINE]Rewards:
				[NEWLINE][ICON_BULLET]+10% [ICON_FOOD] Growth in all Cities and +3 [ICON_HAPPINESS_1] Happiness from Luminous Gardens.

				Your Knights are your most trusted Magical Girls, such as Sayaka Miki and Nagisa Momoe were in previous timelines. Appointing {1_MagicalGirlName} as your Knight will grant her a tremendous amount of power and influence, but you may only maintain one Knight due to your greatly diminished influence on this world in comparison with your home world.[NEWLINE]
				[NEWLINE]Requirement/Restrictions:
				[NEWLINE][ICON_BULLET]Player must be Madoka's Realm
				[NEWLINE][ICON_BULLET]{1_MagicalGirlName} must be level 4 or higher
				[NEWLINE][ICON_BULLET]Must not have any Leader Magical Girls
				[NEWLINE]Costs:
				[NEWLINE][ICON_BULLET]{2_Faith} [ICON_PEACE] Faith
				[NEWLINE]Rewards:
				[NEWLINE][ICON_BULLET]{1_MagicalGirlName} will become a Leader Magical Girl, and gain all of the associated benefits.
