			<Text>
				Julius Little was a man who grew up in Sunnyvale Gardens together with his best friend Benjamin King. After the Carnales, led by Alejandro Lopez came to Stilwater, took over the city and 'abused' Sunnyvale Gardens, Benjamin called all the people of Sunnyvale, including Julius, together and started a revolt against the Carnales. This gang would be known as the Vice Kings. However, Julius didn't like the way the Vice Kings worked and dropped his flags. He thought King could at least keep order in the city but his grip slipped: Los Carnales regrouped and the Westside Rollerz were formed. After the district to where Julius fled, Saint's Row, was made as a battlefield for the three gangs, Julius gathered all the people he could find to the old Church on 3rd Street. While the Vice Kings had become just another crime gang, Julius naively believed he could learn from that failure and keep control. Julius Little originally wanted the 3rd Street Saints color to be green.

				Your very mention strikes fear into the hearts of men, wrathful Pierce Wa--[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]...wait, hold the fuck up. PIERCE is running this show?! Where's the Boss, y'know, the actual leader of the Saints and the one people actually LIKE? ...oh, makes sense. Yeah, Boss has better shit to do than sit in an office doing paperwork and bothering with PR.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Okay, let's try this again.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Supposedly noble Pierce Washington, honor would surround your name if anybody actually gave a fuck about you. The only thing bigger than that sex doll collection of yours is the shadow the Boss casts over every last one of your accomplishments. You're here for one reason, and one reason only: because the Boss would much rather be on the front lines, striking down all who oppose them with giant purple dildos. Still though, you're kinda okay at doing this whole "lead a country" thing, I guess. The Saints find themselves at the dawn of human civilization, and it's up to you -- God forbid -- to build them back into the biggest gang in the world. Can you rebuild the might of th -- are you seriously listening to Milli Vanilli right now?! Fuck it, I'm done here. No, Milli Vanilli is NOT "a'ight." Look, just shut the fuck up and go build a Civilization that can stand the test of time before I slap that hipster-ass beret off your head.
