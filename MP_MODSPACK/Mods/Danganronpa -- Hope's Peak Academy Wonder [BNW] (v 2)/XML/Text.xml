				Hope's Peak Private Academy is an exclusive, government-sanctioned school accepting only students with exceptional abilities. its stated goal is to raise the future “hope” of the nation, and for that reason, it became known as “The Academy of Hope”. It's a source of envy for average high school students, as it's common knowledge that one can gain great success in life just by being a Hope's Peak graduate. Certainly, many Hope's Peak graduates are now employed in high positions in every field of the professional world, so that statement is not an exaggeration.
