				This...this can't be real. I must be dreaming! Me, the only one out of all of the CPUs who knows that the term "hard work" actually entails… was beaten by the likes of YOU?! I can't believe… this is absurd! I refuse to believe this is happening! Wha- all my Shares are draining! Am I dying?! N-no, I still wanted to see her and her silly face again...[NEWLINE][COLOR:127:127:127:255](She finally breaks down in tears as she starts to wither away without the power of Shares giving her life.)[ENDCOLOR]

				*sniff* All those years spent hunting for a CPU Memory. All those years building this city from the ground up without hearing from Plutia once… and for what?

				I'm pretty busy, so we're going to keep this short. I'm Noire, and this is Lastation, the land where greatness awaits. The best nation in Gamindustri, if I do say so myself. I've poured my blood, sweat, and tears into everything I do to make this nation so excellent. I'll be perfectly fine with you staying over in your corner of the world while I get my work finished. So if you'll excuse me, I've got paperwork to do.

				Huh. You mean I met someone new without them falling at terminal velocity onto my dainty body? I'm not kidding. You have no idea how chronic of a problem that is for me… but anyways, let's get down to business. I may be a young CPU, but my devotion to this country is second to none. I look forward to pleasant relations between the two of us, but I won't hesitate to defend Lastation should you get any nasty ideas.

				It's good to know that this dimension has reliable leaders OTHER than myself for a change. I mean, I suppose it's a problem from a competitive standpoint, but it's better than having your next-door neighbor country be so inept that it destabilizes the entire region.

		<Row Tag="TXT_KEY_LEADER_VV_UDNOIRE_DEC_FRIENDSHIP_1">
			<Text>I've learned something recently. Lastation may be a powerful nation, but it can be even more powerful with alliances.

		<Row Tag="TXT_KEY_LEADER_VV_NOIRE_INSULT_CULTURE_1">
			<Text>It's frankly amazing to me that we can even communicate right now. Your culture being what it is, I'm surprised you even have a useable language. Maybe go work on that so I don't have to listen to you anymore.</Text>

				Ack! Who would have thought the little brat would have been the one out of the four of us to win the Console War?! Tch! Hold on, what are you doing? You can't put that guy with the gigantic sword in Mega Mash Sisters! He's never even appeared on a Lowee game console!! What are you doing to my intellectual property?! This is awful!

				Okay, so I read that book you loaned me. It was okay, but seemed a little cliche...[NEWLINE]Huh? C-cosplay as the main heroine?! Ahem. Well, first of all, if I WAS into cosplay -- which I'm not! -- I would have at least a dozen characters I'd rather do first, all with better outfits and backstories! Sheesh, look, maybe I could give you some tips about character design sometime.

				I'm glad you stopped getting angry over Lastation Move and how it supposedly copied from the Lowee console. I'll have you know it was independently developed and had absolutely nothing to do with the runaway success of your implementation of motion controls! Now I just need to get Vert off my back about Lastation Eye.

				You know, you could get a lot more work done if you switched over to audiobooks. Or at least move over to eBooks so your room isn't crammed full of crammed-full bookshelves. Ohhh, right. You're one of those who really enjoys the feeling of turning physical pages made of real paper, and all that old fashioned stuff. I suppose that's understandable, but you'll never catch up to Lastation's glory if your nose is constantly stuck in a book.

Well, putting that aside...I hope that Leanbox and Lastation can work together for the greater good. Oh, and of course, the answer is "no." Yes, I knew you were going to ask about costumes from that MMO you play all the time.

				How many Leanbox game discs have been ground into unusability by the simple act of setting the console on its side? Don't worry, they still make quite fancy drink coasters, haha! Though I'd say that was their most entertaining purpose even when they functioned in the console.

				You know, I thought you might be all right, Neptune might be a complete dumbass but she's usually a decent judge of character. But you... I don't really know where you came from or why, but it's time for you to be destroyed. Why, you ask? Uni came home after visiting Planeptune.
