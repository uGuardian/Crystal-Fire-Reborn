				Leanbox is one of the four primary countries which comprise Gamindustri. The beautiful, verdant land of Leanbox is led by the serene Lady Green Heart, on the rare occasions she isn't grinding daily quests on all 20 of her alts, attempting to smother IF with her royal orbs, or stealing one of the CPU Candidates to claim as her own little sister. Leanbox is known for its medieval architecture and obsolete social structures such as aristocracy and knighthood. However, in some dimensions, these characteristics have been left behind in favor of rapid modernization.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]For the purposes of this mod, Leanbox (and Vert) will be largely characterized by its portrayal in Hyperdimension Neptunia Re;Birth 1.

Despite predating Leanbox Live, the mere mention of PlaneptuneNet can elicit uproarious laughter from Green Heart, Black Heart, and even White Heart due to its failure.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Incidentally, Green Heart herself is prone to sneaking off to Planeptune to play at their arcades, due to their greater variety of games.

				Some may consider the term "fujoshi" to be an insult, but you wear it as a badge of honor. And as such, you can't help but fantasize about {1_LeaderName} and {2_LeaderName} doing some lewd things to each other (after the requisite drama which is virtually required by law in homosexual romance stories). Perhaps if you were to commission a visual novel of the two of them from one of your favorite foreign game companies, and if they were to...somehow...be exposed to it, it might help them see the One True Path of the Yaoi End. And then you can take the credit for playing Cupid.[NEWLINE]
				[NEWLINE]Rewards:
				[NEWLINE][ICON_BULLET]Diplomatic Relations between {1_LeaderName} and {2_LeaderName} increase for {3_Turns} turns.
				[NEWLINE][ICON_BULLET]If the two of them accept a Declaration of Friendship between each other, you will gain 0.5% [ICON_HDN_SHARES] Shares per turn as long as this Decision is active and their Declaration of Friendship remains intact.

Conveniently, since all of these cameras are connected to your Basilicom, it gives you instant access to pretty much every event happening in your empire. And, best of all, news outlets which have heard about the project have taken to calling you "Big Sister!" You've always wanted to be called that![NEWLINE]
