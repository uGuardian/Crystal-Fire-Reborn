				Lowee is one of the four primary countries which comprise Gamindustri. Lowee's gelid climate is harsh, but it nonetheless rose to power as a major player on the Gamindustri stage under the guidance of White Heart. Lowee has a very festive look about it, with rainbows, multicolored buildings, and balloons dotting the landscape. It is well known for having a much more diverse populace than the other Gamindustri nations, gleefully accepting immigrants of much older or younger ages than other nations.
