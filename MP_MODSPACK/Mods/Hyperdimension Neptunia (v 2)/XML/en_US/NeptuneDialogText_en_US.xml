				Huh. Well, how 'bout that? I lost! I mean, of course that means that you're one of those bosses I was supposed to lose to, right?[NEWLINE]You're sacking the city?! How cruel! Surely you're just pulling my leg, right? Ahahaha! ...you're not? Well...surely I'll get my second wind with some new super-power-up to beat you now, right? I mean, it's not like...it's not like I was too preoccupied with playing games and eating sweets to actually protect my country, right? *sniff* Of course it's not like I've really been the laziest, worst leader I could have been *sniff* in this terrible time for Planeptune, right? I'm the main character of Neptunia, I always win in the end! Right?! R-right...[NEWLINE][NEWLINE][COLOR:127:127:127:255](After she looks around at her burning city and the hundreds of dead soldiers around her, her eternally upbeat personality finally falls apart and she starts bawling her eyes out.)[ENDCOLOR]

				Event flag triggered, new character met! How's it going, dude and/or dudette, and I won't specify which because Vice is too lazy to do that right now! My name's Neptune! Everyone calls me silly stuff like Nep-Nep, Nep, Neppy, Neptuna, and whatever else, though...I mean, I'm kind of important, my name's worth remembering properly, isn't it? Oh, and, my official CPU name is Purple Heart, but that's not really important. What IS important is that we celebrate the start of this relationship with a big tub of pudding and an epic gaming session that's gonna be streamed! Maybe I'll get more than 4 viewers this time!

Histy wanted me say I meant Symantecs, but don't I'd think virus monsters have anything to do with this. Anyway, I was thinking we could announce to the whole world that we're officially BFFs and all. It'd make great headlines! Everyone would be jealous of our burgeoning childlike love for each other as we fed each other pudding under a shaded oak tree...[NEWLINE]Oh, don't look like that, I'm just teasing you.
