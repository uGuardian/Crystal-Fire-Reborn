			Luca is actually the adopted daughter of Reisha and Batz Trulyworth, and the child of the 32nd Holy Maiden of Pastalia, Lady Arshe. Her true name is Cloche Leythal Pastalia, but her name was changed to Luca to cover up her identity after Arshe was killed as a result of a conspiracy by Alfman. At 2 years old, she was taken away from Enna Palace by Batz and Reisha for her own protection, and they had to live hiding and running to keep her safe. Finally, after some time, they finally settled in the town of Mint Ward, where Reisha gave birth to another daughter, Leyka. Together, they formed a poor, but very happy family. However, these times came to an abrupt and sad end when Leyka ended having an IPD outbreak, and was taken away by Dr. Laude and the Grand Bell to be contained. Batz died in this incident trying to save her. This incident ended carving a very deep and unerasable scar in Luca's psyche. Not even the fact that Croix was adopted by Reisha little after this incident was enough to compensate for it. Later on, she began to suffer more because Reisha chose to act cold and uncaring towards her to avoid hurting her if someday the Grand Bell learned of her true ascendence and took her away. However, this only worsened their relation, and made Luca's personality cheery on the exterior, but cold and bitter inside. At 13 years old, she entered to work in a restaurant in the nearby town of Rakshek, but she later decided to leave to become a Dive Therapist, given that she had a very good experience with her first Dive session, even though her mother had forbidden her to do it. This also was motivated because her work on the restaurant was too hard because of the costumers, and she was unable to defend herself if any of them decided to pick on her; and also, because the work as therapist offered a much higher pay. Luca quickly showed her talents being able to create a restricted field in her mind in a few tries, but the training sessions were so hard and dangerous, that she might have died during them. Around this time, she also began going on dates with Croix, and even if she loved him, their relation was pretty shallow, since she was mostly using him as a tool for getting to Pastalia, getting close to the Grand Bell, and rescuing Leyka. A certain day, Croix came back with news that he was accepted into the Knights of the Grand Bell, and departed for Pastalia. Luca was left behind, awaiting anxiously for the day in which she would be able to go to Pastalia with him.

			6 years later, Luca now 19, receives the fateful message from Croix to come to Pastalia. However, the day before her departure after doing her Therapy shift, she bumps into Croix. She then meets Cocona, Croix's adopted little Sister, and the 33rd Holy Maiden, Cloche Leythal Pastalia. Luca greets Cocona with a kind and cheery attitude, then turns to Cloche. At first she could not believe who she is but Croix erases her doubts. Luca's sudden burst out on meeting the one and only Holy Maiden makes the people around leave or confused at the situation. Cloche introduces herself and Luca replies both cheerily and nervously. Cloche asks Luca about her occupation and when she replies that she is a dive therapist, Cloche recoils in surprise and anger so much she draws her sword stating that Dive Therapy is a dirty and unscrupulous job, and also stating that her relationship with Croix is a disgrace to the name of the Knights. This serves to create a wall of misunderstanding and hatred between Luca and Cloche. Cloche later asks Croix to Dive with her, claiming it is purely for self-defense, but this maybe in spite of Luca being his girlfriend. Luca is surprised at her "bold" words and replies in a very shocked manner. Later on they meet Luca's friend Skycat, a waitress who works at the restaurant where Luca used to work before she became a Dive Therapist. Skycat treats Luca with a lot of respect even though they never worked together. Croix has also become quite the celebrity in Rakshek as most people recognize him as Luca's boyfriend. Some even call him Luca's fiance which surprises the entire group, even Croix himself. Luca is always acting weird or uncomfortable whenever someone refers to her and Croix as lovers. However she seems to deny spreading exaggerated rumors and only referring to Croix to people as "a boy she used to live with," although it is highly likely she exaggerated the story and deliberately spread it around town. Why she did this is somewhat questionable because Luca is mostly using Croix to save Leyka. Perhaps it is part of her plan to get Croix to help her or maybe it is a sign of some true feelings she has for him.
