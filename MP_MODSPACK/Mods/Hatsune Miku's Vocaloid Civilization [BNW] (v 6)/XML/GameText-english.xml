				In 2012, a poll was taken of viewers of the London 2012 Olympic Games, asking which musical artist they would like to see perform at the event. Miku received the most votes in the poll, beating even very popular singers such as Justin Bieber. However, the poll was not intended to make an actual decision regarding the artist(s) who would play at the event, so she never performed there.

				Hatsune Miku is a Japanese VOCALOID developed and distributed by Crypton Future Media, Inc., and was initially released in August 2007 for the VOCALOID2 engine. It is part of the Character Vocal Series. There has since been numerous installments such as additional voice banks dubbed 'Append', as well as an upgrade to the VOCALOID3 engine, which includes her long awaited English vocal release. She was the first release for Crypton's VOCALOID Character Vocal Series, the third Japanese VOCALOID, and the seventh VOCALOID to have been created overall. She is considered the most popular and well known VOCALOID and the first to become a pop idol. Her voice is provided by the Japanese female voice actress, Saki Fujita.

				Greetings, Hatsune Miku, leader of the Vocaloids with the voice known as the "First Sound of the Future!" You were created in 2007 as an "artifical pop star," and your popularity exploded to the point that you had more fans than many real musical acts. Because anyone could use the Vocaloid software to create new songs, your voice traveled further than any singer of flesh and blood could ever hope to. You ultimately became one of Japan's biggest pop stars, and the most successful "fake" musical artist of all time.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Miku, a grand opportunity has now been granted to you! You find yourself at the dawn of human civilization, with a real body and a small group of your fellow synthetic stars willing to follow your lead. Now is the time to prove yourself as the greatest singer of all time! Can you make the influence of the Vocaloid sound encompass the world? Can your rule become so glorious that you can truly say "The World is Mine" and mean it? Will you build a Civilization that can stand the test of time?

				Vocaloid is a singing voice synthesizer. Its signal processing part was developed through a joint research project led by Kenmochi Hideki at the Pompeu Fabra University in Barcelona, Catalonia, Spain, in 2000 (the same team that later founded Voctro Labs) and originally was not intended to be a full commercial project. Backed by the Yamaha Corporation, it developed the software into the commercial product "Vocaloid." The software enables users to synthesize singing by typing in lyrics and melody. It uses synthesizing technology with specially recorded vocals of voice actors or singers. To create a song, the user must input the melody and lyrics. A piano roll type interface is used to input the melody and the lyrics can be entered on each note. The software can change the stress of the pronunciations, add effects such as vibrato, or change the dynamics and tone of the voice. Each Vocaloid is sold as "a singer in a box" designed to act as a replacement for an actual singer. The software was originally only available in English starting with the first Vocaloids Leon, Lola and Miriam and Japanese with Meiko and Kaito, but Vocaloid 3 has added support for Spanish for the Vocaloids Bruno, Clara and Maika; Chinese for Luo Tianyi and Yan He; Korean for SeeU, Catalan for Ona, and French for ALYS.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]In the context of Civilization 5, the Vocaloids have somehow turned into sentient beings, although whether they are mechanical or organic in nature is unknown. Their capital is named after the Yamaha Corporation which was responsible for funding the creation of Vocaloid, and their other cities are named after the other companies which license the engine to create their own Vocaloid "singers." Spies are named after members of the Yamaha Corporation board of directors.
