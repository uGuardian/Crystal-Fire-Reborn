				Utau (stylized and most often referred to as UTAU) is a Japanese singing synthesizer application created by Ameya/Ayame. This program is similar to the Vocaloid software, with the difference that it is freeware instead of being released under third party licensing.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]In Vocaloid culture, their status as freeware and their relative lack of popularity compared to Vocaloids have led to harsh prejudices towards them throughout history. The official endorsement of an UTAUloid Guild marks the beginning of the end of that discrimination.
