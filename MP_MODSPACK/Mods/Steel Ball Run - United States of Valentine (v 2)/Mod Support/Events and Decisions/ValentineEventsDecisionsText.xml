				Sometimes, all it takes is a simple gesture and a single word to make your popularity skyrocket. You're already popular with both your constituents and your cabinet. But by making a conscious effort to punctuate your speeches and even simple press reports with your trademark "Dojyan!" onomatopoeia paired with a shrug, it is sure to help you become embedded in the public consciousness. This should hopefully endear you to your public for years to come.[NEWLINE]
