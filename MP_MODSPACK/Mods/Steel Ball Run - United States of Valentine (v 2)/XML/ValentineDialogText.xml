				...all is lost. Well, then, are you going to strike me down? Hurry up and do it. I won't have D4C bring me another "body," because there is no longer any reason for it. The United States lies in shambles. Whatever reason I had to live is gone. Truly, "justice" has left the world this day...

				Salutations. My name is Funny Valentine, and I lead the greatest nation on Earth. Never cross the path of the United States if you know what's good for you. There is nothing I will not do to make this country the greatest and happiest in the world...nothing.

				All my actions are for one thing and one thing only: my country. It appears that has not been enough to discourage you from attacking us. I will repent later; for now, I will find a way to destroy you and your army!

			<Text>
				Our people are now buying your blue jeans and listening to your pop music.[NEWLINE]So much so that I've had to use D4C to bring more of them in from other dimensions. It will be quite amusing to see two people wearing the same pair of pants from different dimensions meet each other.

				This is a "betrayal," you say? Hardly. I have never trusted you from the beginning. And "betrayal" implies that it's an evil act. But what I'm doing is not evil. For my heart and actions are utterly unclouded. They are all those of "justice!"
